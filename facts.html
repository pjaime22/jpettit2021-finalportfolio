    <p> There are 33 species of pinnipeds today, most of whom are seals. Pinnipeds are categorized into 
      three groups; walruses, "eared seals" or sea lions, and earless seals, known as true seals. Earless
      seals do however have ears, they're just hidden beneath their skin. Seals come in all sorts of shapes 
      and sizes and are found on every continent on Earth. They range from the giant southern elephant seal, which
      can weigh more than a pick up truck, to the slender, 100 pound Baikal seal. However, all seals have something
      in common. Thick layers of fat, known as blubber, keeps them warm, in addition to dense fur. As species also 
      have feet shaped like fins. In fact, the work pinniped means "fin-footed in Latin." These fin-shaped feet
      make them supreme swimmers and all pinnipeds are considered semi-aquatic marine mammals. This means they 
      spend some part of their lives on land or sea ice, usually during pupping or mating season.

      Fossil records indicate that the ancestors of modern seals first entered the ocean on the west coast, about 
      28–30 million years ago.Seals evolved from carnivorous ancestors that walked on land with sturdy legs; only 
      later did these evolve into the flippers that the family is known for. Seals also have a long history with humans.
      Thirty-two species of sea lion and seals have been held in captivity with the first captive seals dating back to
      the Roman Empire. They were displayed around the Empire in travelling circuses or zoological gardens, where 
      they were trained for public entertainment. The display of seals in travelling circuses around Europe continued
      through to the 1800s with handbills advertising them as “talking fish,” “merman,” or “sea monsters.” In the United 
      States, seals were stars at the country’s first aquarium—the Boston Aquarial Gardens. Ned and Fanny were likely 
      harbor seals and, acquired in 1856, were soon trained to perform complicated tricks like playing a hand organ. 
      In New York, the endangered Caribbean monk seal became the most popular attraction at the New York Aquarium, 
      which housed a number of seals from this species throughout the early 1900s. These seals, Nellie and Tom,
       were celebrities in the City, with their deaths even reported in the New York newspapers and their remains 
       donated to the collection of the American Museum of Natural History.  Today, harbor seals and California sea 
       lions are the most common pinnipeds in zoos and aquariums. 
      <br><br>
      The most famous pinniped in New England was a seal named Andre. In 1961, Harry Goodridge, the harbormaster of Rockport Harbor,
       Maine, adopted an abandoned harbor seal found in the Penobscot Bay, Maine. Named Andre, the seal chose to stay with Goodridge 
       and for the rest of his life he spent the warm seasons in Penobscot Bay. As a pup, Andre lived in the Goodridge house and would 
       even watch television with the family. Later, he and Goodridge would perform daily shows on the docks for tourists, a tradition 
       that lasted until Andre’s death at 25 years old in 1986. Today, a statue of Andre sits on the shore of Rockport Harbor.
