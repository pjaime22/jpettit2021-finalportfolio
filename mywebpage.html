    <p> Welcome! This is a site dedicated to facts about the Atlantic harbor seal and its cousins!
      <br><br>
      Atlantic harbor seals are found in Artic and temperate waters on the eastern coast of North America. 
      They are one of the most prevalent species of seal one can find today! Atlantic harbor seals are one of
      four subspecies of harbor seals, the other three being the Pacific harbor seal, the Ungava harbor Seal
      found in Northern Canada, and the insular harbor seal of East Asia.  Harbor seals can live for up to forty years in captivity and can breed throughout their lives. Their favorite foods include
      squid, herring, and capelin. Capelin are particularly important to harbor seals as they contain fresh
      water that seals cannot access elsewhere. They are also known to follow after fishing boats to eat whatever
      fishermen toss overboard. Sometimes, they will raid lobster traps- usually to go after the bait rather than
      the lobsters inside.<br><br>Harbor seal-watching is a popular hobby in Long Island Sound in
      the winter months. Harbor seals travel from Northern waters to Long Island Sound in November-December and 
      remain there until mid March-April. They will then travel to the coast of Maine to mate and pup. A seal 
      mother has a pup each Spring, which can swim very shortly after birth. For harbor seals, the pup's baby 
      coat is often molted completely or partially before birth. Baby harbor seals can nurse in the water as well as on land and
      will be weaned at 4-6 weeks of age. The mother seals will mate again after this happens, as well as molt
      after the pupping season ends.
      
      <br><br>Harbor seals are most often seen by people when they "haul out" onto rocks or other pieces of land
      to sun themselves. They will often lift their head and rear flippers up into a bananna pose. Seals will rest
      in the water in an upright position with their heads poking through the surface. This post is sometimes called
      bottling. It takes a while for one's eyes to become accustomed finding seals heads poking out of the water, due
      to their dark fur being very good camouflage. A seal can dive very deep. Reports of maximum diving ability 
      range from 600ft to 1500 feet in depth. They can hold their breaths for thiry minutes. However, seals usually 
      do not need to dive so deep, as fish can be found in shallower waters. Harbor seals also tend to be very social,
      the often swim or bask alone or in small groups. They can also form large groups on land. However, seals are very
      shy and will slip back into the water if they sense danger. They need quiet beaches to raise their pups.
